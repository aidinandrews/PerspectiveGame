Perspective Game TODO

Entity Loop:
1) solve collisions
	initialize: find collisions and flag them
	1a) propagate flagged collisions to colliding entities
	1b) find any remaining collisions and flag them
	1c) if no remaining collisions: escape, else: loop to step 1a.
2) send data to GPU
3) move entities

TODO:
1) get the entities to move around both orthogonally and diagonally
2) collisions
	- find direct collisions
	- find shifted collisions
	- find corner collisions
3) solving
	- swap opposing forces and make sure both entities are flagged for solving next solve step
	- pseudo directions need to be added to static entities.
		-* pseudo directions do not swap, but spread flagged-ness to other entities!
	- allow for force combination/division by adding a designated float to each force
		- force combination adds 1 force unit/added force of the same direction to an entity
		- force division adds (force float / 2) to each effected entity
			-* floating point error will be an issue with this step for long sequences of division!
