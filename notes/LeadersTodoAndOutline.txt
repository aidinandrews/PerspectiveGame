Leaders TODO

How it works:

leaders (may be) created/promoted when:
	1) block is created (and promoted)
	2) force is propagated (static block promoted)
	3) block is moved (old left/right neighbors promoted)
	4) block is destroyed (follower promoted)

leaders (may be) destroyed/demoted when:
	1) block is destroyed (and demoted first)
	2) force is eaten (leader on eaten tile demoted)
	3) block is moved (new left/right neighbors demoted)

details:

ON CREATE BLOCK:

if new block tile has no force:
|	new block = static
|	return

if has no neighbors in direction of force:
|	new block = leader
|	return

if neighbor has no followers:
|	neighbor follower = new block
|	return

if new block direction higher priority than follower direction
|	neighbor follower = new block
|	return
else
|	new block = static
|	return
